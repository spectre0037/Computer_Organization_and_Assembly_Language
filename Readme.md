# COAL-LAB (CE-222)

Welcome to the COAL-LAB (Computer Organization and Assembly Language) course at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute. This course is divided into three main parts: Logisim, Assembly Language (RISC-V architecture), and Verilog on VIVADO.

## Course Structure

### Part 1: Logisim

</div>

In this part, you will learn about digital logic design using Logisim. Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.

</div>

#### Topics Covered:
- Basic Logic Gates
- Combinational Circuits
- Sequential Circuits
- Memory Elements
- Arithmetic Circuits

### Part 2: Assembly Language (RISC-V Architecture)

</div>

This part focuses on programming in assembly language using the RISC-V architecture. You will learn how to write and understand low-level code that interacts directly with the hardware.
