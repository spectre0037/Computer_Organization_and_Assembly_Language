## 📚 Course Structure 📚

### Part 1: Logisim

</div>

In this part, you will learn about digital logic design using Logisim. Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.

</div>

#### Topics Covered:
- 🔹 Basic Logic Gates
- 🔹 Combinational Circuits
- 🔹 Sequential Circuits
- 🔹 Memory Elements
- 🔹 Arithmetic Circuits
