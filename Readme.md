# 🎓 COAL-LAB (CE-222) 🎓

Welcome to the COAL-LAB (Computer Organization and Assembly Language) course at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute. This course is divided into three main parts: Logisim, Assembly Language (RISC-V architecture), and Verilog on VIVADO.

## 📚 Course Structure 📚

### Part 1: Logisim
In this part, you will learn about digital logic design using Logisim. Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.

#### Topics Covered:
- 🔹 Basic Logic Gates
- 🔹 Combinational Circuits
- 🔹 Sequential Circuits
- 🔹 Memory Elements
- 🔹 Arithmetic Circuits

### Part 2: Assembly Language (RISC-V Architecture)
This part focuses on programming in assembly language using the RISC-V architecture. You will learn how to write and understand low-level code that interacts directly with the hardware.

#### Topics Covered:
- 🔹 Introduction to RISC-V
- 🔹 Basic Assembly Instructions
- 🔹 Control Flow Instructions
- 🔹 Data Movement Instructions
- 🔹 Subroutines and Functions
- 🔹 Interrupts and Exceptions

### Part 3: Verilog on VIVADO
In the final part, you will learn hardware description language (HDL) using Verilog and implement your designs on the VIVADO platform.
